		<p>readESM - digital tachograph file reader

This program takes an ESM file, as downloaded from a digital tachograph or a
driver card, a compulsory equipment for trucks heavier than 3.5 tons within the
European Union. It converts said files into human-readable form, either html or
simple plaintext.

So far the program just does this conversion, with a few datasets still unread,
and does little analysis of the data. More analysis is planned for the future,
but any serious attempt requires refactoring the data heavily, which might never
be done due to time constraints.

The digital tachographs and respective cards use industry standard security, 
with 1024-bit rsa, sha-1 hashes and individual certificates on each card
signed by ec member states authorities. The software checks the signatures and
certification chain for correctness, so far without checking the revoked-key
list.

The language of the project is C++, and development is done on a linux platform,
but it should be possible to compile it on any platform with a C++-compiler,
Qt, the stdlib and shared_ptr from boost. For signature checking the Gnu MP 
library and libgcrypt are needed.
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Ubuntu packages</h3>
<p>There are precompiled packages in <a href="">my personal package archive</a>.
Installation in Ubuntu should work by typing
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:k-2005/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install readesm</pre>
Afterwards you can start readesm by typing <i>readesm</i> on the command line,
and associate a file extension with it.

<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>You can get the program files from
<a href="http://andreas.goelzer.de/readesm-reading-digital-tachograph-files">
my homepage</a>, or from
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/readesm/">development page</a> 
at Sourceforge.</p>

<p>To compile, you need
<ul>
	<li>a C++ compiler of your choice,</li>
	<li>a Makefile parser of your choice,</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org/">cmake</a> as a Makefile generator,</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://qt.nokia.com">Qt</a>, specifically the modules
		QtCore, QtGui and QtWebKit.</li>
</ul>
If you want to check wether the signatures in the tachograph data check out, 
you also need:
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="http://gmplib.org/">Gnu MP Library</a> and</li>
	<li>the <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/project/libgcrypt/">
		gcrypt</a> library.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you have all prerequisites installed, unpack a release tarball or get the 
source from svn, then build with cmake. In Ubuntu you might do something like:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev qt4-qmake libqtwebkit-dev libgcrypt11-dev libgmp3-dev
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essentials subversion
svn co https://readesm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/readesm readesm
cd readesm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Running the program</h2>
<p><ul>
	<li>Start readesm with no arguments.  On Unix systems, this should be
	<pre>./readesm</pre>
	from the directory in which the executable is located, or just
	<pre>readesm</pre>
	if readesm is installed somewhere in your PATH.  In the User Interface, open a file by selecting "File, Open" in the Menu bar.</li>
	<li>If you start readesm with a filename as argument, readesm will try to open that tachograph file and show it in the User Interface.</li>
	<li>If you start readesm with two filenames as argument, Readesm will assume the first filename to be a tachograph file, and the second filename to be a target file.  It will then try to convert the tachograph file and convert the result into the target file.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<h4><a name="legislation"></a>Where can I get the documentation for the tachograph file format?</h4>
<p>The Tachograph file format, download protocol, printout format and basically everything about digital tachographs is defined in
<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:207:0001:0252:EN:PDF">OJ:L:2002:207, p. 1-252</a>.
As with all european legislation it is available in several languages, for example
<ul><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002R1360:20020825:EN:PDF">English</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002R1360:20020825:ES:PDF">Spanish</a> and</li>
<li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002R1360:20020825:DE:PDF">German</a>.</li></ul>
If you want to view it in another language, replace the <i>EN</i> in the url for the english document with your preferred language code.</p>


<h4>How can I download the data from the vehicle unit?</h4>
<p>I fear you will have to resort to proprietary solutions here.  Alternatively you could code something yourself, the protocol is completely defined in the <a href="#legislation">legislation</a>.  However, testing download algorithms leaves traces on the equipment, so take care your download attempts are not recorded as hacking attempts.</p>

<h4>How can I download the data from the driver card?</h4>
<p>Use <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fahrlinx/">Fahrlinux</a>.</p>

<h2>Modifying the program</h2>
<p>You are free to modify and redistribute the program under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>
<p>If you do so, note:
<ul>
	<li>Sometimes i added references to l207.pdf in the comments, that refers to
	<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:207:0001:0252:EN:PDF">OJ:L:2002:207, p. 1-252</a>, as with all european legislation it is available in several languages.
	</li>
	<li>The code is rather unclean, often two or more classes in the same file, wild
	naming convention(often taken from the european law, which has quite large
	names.</li>
	<li>The code contains <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html">doxygen</a>-style comments. You can access the generated code documentation <a href="http://readesm.sourceforge.net">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
